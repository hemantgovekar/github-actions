# GitHub Actions

## Introduction
- GitHub Actions is a feature in GitHub that allows you to automate tasks and workflows in your repository.
- It is composed of different elements such as triggers, workflows, and actions.

## Triggers
- Triggers are events that can initiate a workflow.
- Examples of triggers include push events, pull request events, and scheduled events.

## Workflows
- Workflows are a set of steps that are executed when a trigger event occurs.
- Workflows are defined in YAML files and can be customized to fit your needs.
- They can include multiple jobs and can run on different platforms and environments.

## Actions
- Actions are the individual tasks or steps that make up a workflow.
- They can be pre-built actions provided by GitHub or custom actions created by you or the community.
- Actions can be used to build, test, deploy, and perform other tasks in your workflow.

## Creating a Workflow
- To create a workflow, you need to define it in a YAML file called `workflow.yml` or any other name you prefer.
- The YAML file should be placed in the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
- You can define the trigger event, specify the jobs and steps to be executed, and configure other settings.

## Advanced Features
- Secrets Management: GitHub Actions allows you to store and use secrets securely in your workflows.
- Environments: You can define different environments for your workflows, such as production and staging, and deploy your code accordingly.

GitHub Actions is a full automation engine that allows you to automate various tasks and workflows in your GitHub repositories. It provides a way to respond to different GitHub events and trigger actions based on those events. Here are some key points to understand about GitHub Actions:

- GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that can be used to automate almost anything.
- It responds to various GitHub events such as pushing code to a repository, creating a new branch, creating a new issue, adding a new comment, making API calls, and more.
- It allows you to define workflows as code, which means you can specify the actions to be performed in a YAML file.
- GitHub Actions is fully integrated with GitHub, making it easy to use and access.
- It is community-powered, meaning there are thousands of pre-built actions available that you can use in your workflows.

## Triggering Actions

GitHub Actions can be triggered by different events. Some common triggers include:

- Pushing code to a repository
- Creating a new branch
- Creating a new issue
- Adding a new comment
- Making API calls

## Workflow as Code

Workflows in GitHub Actions are defined as code using a YAML file. This file specifies the actions to be performed and the conditions under which they should be triggered. Here's an example of a simple workflow:

```yaml
name: My Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build project
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered when code is pushed to the `main` branch or when a pull request is made to the `main` branch. The workflow consists of a single job called `build`, which runs on an Ubuntu environment. The steps in the job include checking out the code and building the project.

## Pre-built Actions

GitHub Actions has a vast library of pre-built actions that you can use in your workflows. These actions are created by the community and cover a wide range of tasks. Some examples of pre-built actions include:

- Sending notifications
- Deploying to cloud platforms
- Running tests
- Publishing packages
- Generating documentation

You can easily find and use these pre-built actions in # Smart Study Notes: Automating Tasks with GitHub Actions

## YAML in Workflows
- YAML is used to define workflows in applications.
- It specifies the actions and tasks to be performed.
- Everything in workflows is written in YAML format.

## Events in Workflows
- Events are triggers that initiate actions in workflows.
- Events are specified in the YAML file using the "on" clause.
- Events can be:
  - Traditional events like pushing code or creating a pull request.
  - Scheduled events that run the action at a predefined interval.
  - Manual events triggered by using the "workflow_dispatch" event.
  - Repository events triggered by using the "repository_dispatch" event. # Main Topic: GitHub Actions Workflows

## Introduction to GitHub Actions Workflows
GitHub Actions workflows allow you to automate your software development processes. They are made up of one or more jobs, which are a series of steps that are executed on a specific runner. Workflows can be triggered by various events, such as push or pull requests, scheduled events, or manual triggers.

## Triggering Workflows
Workflows can be triggered by different events, including:
- Push events: When code is pushed to the repository.
- Pull request events: When a pull request is opened or updated.
- Schedule events: When a specific time or interval is reached.
- Workflow dispatch events: Manually triggering the workflow.

## Combining Triggers
You can combine multiple triggers in a single workflow. For example:
- Schedule + Push event: The workflow will run on a schedule and also when code is pushed to the repository.
- Push event + Pull request event: The workflow will run when code is pushed and when a pull request is opened or updated.
- Workflow dispatch event: Allows manual triggering of the workflow.

## Best Practices
- During the development process, it is recommended to include the `workflow_dispatch` event in your workflows. This allows you to manually trigger the workflow for testing and debugging purposes, without having to push code or create issues.
- Adding this event helps in trying out the workflow without making unnecessary changes to the repository.

## Comparison to Other Tools
GitHub Actions workflows can be compared to pipelines in Jenkins or Azure DevOps. They serve a similar purpose of automating software development processes.

## Conclusion
GitHub Actions workflows provide a powerful way to automate your software development processes. By combining different triggers and following best practices, you can create efficient and effective workflows that streamline your development workflow. # GitHub Actions and YAML

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows. It uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) to describe the operations and tasks you want to achieve.

## YAML in GitHub Actions

YAML is a human-readable data serialization format. In the context of GitHub Actions, YAML is used to define the steps and configurations for your workflows.

- YAML is used to describe the operations and tasks you want to achieve.
- It allows you to define the steps and configurations for your workflows.

## Using YAML to Define Operations

In GitHub Actions, you can use YAML to define the operations and tasks you want to achieve. This allows you to specify what you want to do and how you want to do it.

- YAML is used to describe what you want to achieve and how you want to achieve it.
- You can specify the operations and tasks you want to perform using YAML.

## Using YAML to Define Variables

YAML also allows you to define variables that can be used in your workflows. These variables can be used to customize and parameterize your workflows.

- YAML allows you to define variables that can be used in your workflows.
- These variables can be used to customize and parameterize your workflows.

## Using YAML to Define Matrices

In GitHub Actions, you can use YAML to define matrices. Matrices allow you to define multiple combinations of variables and execute your workflows for each combination.

- YAML can be used to define matrices in GitHub Actions.
- Matrices allow you to define multiple combinations of variables.
- Workflows can be executed for each combination defined in the matrix.

## Example: Matrix with Variables

Let's take an example of a matrix with two variables: `node version` and `OS`.

- `node version` has three values: 8, 10, and 12.
- `OS` also has three values.

In this case, the job called `build` will be executed nine times. The beauty of using a matrix is that you only need to write the steps once, and GitHub Actions will automatically execute them nine times based on the different variables in the matrix.

- The job `build` will be executed nine times.
- The steps for the job only need to be written once.
- GitHub Actions will automatically execute the job for each combination of variables in the matrix. # GitHub Actions Workflow with Node.js and Mac OS

To set up a GitHub Actions workflow with Node.js on Mac OS, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` folder in the root of your repository. This folder will contain all your workflow files.

2. Inside the `.github/workflows` folder, create a new file with a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension. This file will define your workflow.

3. In the workflow file, start by specifying the events or triggers that will initiate the workflow. These events should be listed in sequence and are the first thing to include in the workflow.

4. After the events, you can define a list of steps. Steps are the actions that will be executed in the workflow. These steps can include pre-existing actions or custom actions.

5. To use Node.js in your workflow, you can specify the version of Node.js you want to use. For example, you can use Node.js version 8 on Mac OS version 10, and Node.js version 12 on Mac OS version 12. 

6. Make sure to write your workflow file in YAML format. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files.

7. Save the workflow file in the `.github/workflows` folder.

Here is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow file for Node.js on Mac OS:

```yaml
name: Node.js Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 12

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

In this example:

- The workflow is triggered on a push event to the `main` branch.
- The workflow runs on the latest version of Mac OS.
- The steps include checking out the code, setting up Node.js version 12, installing dependencies, building the project, and running tests.

Remember to adjust the workflow file according to your specific needs and requirements.

# Smart Study Notes: Action and Shell Scripts

## Action vs Shell Scripts
- An action is a pre-built tool that can be used to perform various operations.
- Parameters of an action can be used to customize its behavior.
- Shell scripts can also be used to perform operations, depending on the operating system.
- On Linux, the shell script is usually written in Bash.
- On Windows, the shell script can be written in Batch, Command Line, or PowerShell.

## Actions in Azure Pipelines
- In Azure Pipelines, actions are used to perform operations.
- Basic operations in actions are often performed using command line.
- For example, in Azure Pipelines, the .NET Core build task can be used to build and publish .NET Core projects.
- In actions, these basic operations are translated into command line commands and executed.

Note: The provided notes were quite fragmented and repetitive. I have condensed the information into concise study notes. # Main Topic: Using the dotnet CLI and pre-built actions in GitHub Actions

## Using the dotnet CLI
- The dotnet CLI is a command-line interface for building, running, and managing .NET applications.
- It can be used to execute commands and perform various operations on .NET projects.
- To run a command using the dotnet CLI, you can use the following syntax: `dotnet <command>`.
- The dotnet CLI is useful for tasks like building, testing, and publishing .NET applications.

## Pre-built actions in GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions provides pre-built actions that can be used to automate various tasks in your workflows.
- These actions are reusable and can be easily integrated into your workflows.
- They are designed to perform specific operations and save you time and effort.
- One example of a pre-built action is the "Use Node.js" action, which is used to ensure that Node.js is installed and configured correctly on the runner machine.
- The "Use Node.js" action performs a series of tasks, such as checking if Node.js is installed, installing it if necessary, ensuring the correct version is installed, and adding the executable path to the runner's PATH variable.
- This action simplifies the process of setting up Node.js for your workflows, as it automates the necessary steps that would otherwise need to be done manually.
- The "Use Node.js" action is just one example of the many pre-built actions available in GitHub Actions.

## Manual vs Automated tasks
- While some tasks, like running `npm install`, can be easily done manually using command-line tools, pre-built actions can simplify and automate more complex operations.
- Pre-built actions are especially useful for tasks that involve multiple steps or require specific configurations.
- Using pre-built actions saves time and effort, as they handle the necessary setup and configuration automatically.
- However, for simpler tasks, it may be more convenient to perform them manually using the appropriate command-line tools.

Note: The provided text was quite fragmented and repetitive, so the notes may not cover all the details. # GitHub Actions Syntax and Runs On

When creating a GitHub Actions workflow, it is important to specify the runs on syntax at the beginning of the job. This is mandatory for each job in the workflow. The runs on syntax tells the GitHub Actions engine where to run the workflow.

- Each job must have a runs on statement.
- The runs on statement can be declarative, specifying a specific operating system like Ubuntu 18.04.
- It can also be dynamic by using variables or a matrix to make it more flexible.

GitHub Actions supports running workflows on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. There are multiple versions available for each operating system.

- For Linux, you can use Ubuntu latest or specific versions like Ubuntu 18.04 or 22.
- For Windows, there are different versions available as well.
- Docker can also be used to execute actions or workflows in a containerized environment. However, currently, using Docker on Windows VMs is not supported.

Example:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test
```

In the above example, the job named "build" runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. The steps within the job include checking out the code and performing build and test operations.

By specifying the runs on syntax, you can ensure that your workflow runs on the desired operating system or environment. # GitHub Actions Study Notes

## Artifacts
- Artifacts are a feature in GitHub Actions that allow you to persist data between jobs in a workflow.
- They are useful for passing data or files from one job to another.
- Artifacts can be uploaded and downloaded using the `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` actions.
- Artifacts can be stored at the repository level or at the organization level.

## Secrets
- Secrets are a way to securely store sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, that can be used in GitHub Actions workflows.
- Secrets can be consumed within your workflows to access sensitive data.
- Secrets can be stored at the repository level or at the organization level.
- To use secrets in your workflows, you need to reference them using the syntax `secrets.<secret_name>`.

## Actions
- Actions are the building blocks of a GitHub Actions workflow.
- Actions are reusable units of code that automate operations.
- Actions can be used to perform specific tasks or operations within a workflow.
- There are two approaches to using actions:
  - Referencing an action: You can reference an existing action by its name and version.
  - Creating a custom action: You can create your own action by defining a YAML file with the necessary steps and configurations.

## Log Streaming
- Log streaming is a feature in GitHub Actions that allows you to view the real-time logs of your workflow runs.
- Log streaming is useful for debugging and monitoring the progress of your workflows.
- You can access the log stream of a workflow run by navigating to the Actions tab in your repository and selecting the specific workflow run.

## Secret Store
- The secret store is a feature in GitHub Actions that allows you to securely store and consume secrets within your workflows.
- Secrets can be stored at the repository level or at the organization level.
- The secret store enables you to access sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, without exposing them in your workflow files.

Note: More details about artifacts, secrets, actions, log streaming, and the secret store will be covered in later modules. # GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a feature on GitHub that allows you to automate tasks and workflows within your repository. It is based on a concept called "actions", which are individual units of work that can be combined to create custom workflows.

## Actions

Actions are essentially scripts or commands that can be executed in response to certain events or triggers. They can be created by you or by others in the GitHub community. Actions can be written in any programming language, as long as they can be converted to run within a Node.js runtime or a Docker container.

To create your own action, you need to provide certain files in your repository:

1. `action.yaml`: This file contains the metadata of your action. It is similar to a `package.json` file and includes information such as inputs, outputs, and other metadata.

2. `index.js`: This is the main file for your action. It serves as the entry point for your action and contains the code that will be executed. You can also split your action into multiple files, but these two files (`action.yaml` and `index.js`) are required.

## Running Actions

GitHub Actions engine runs actions in a Node.js runtime or within a Docker container. You can choose to provide your own Docker container if needed.

When an action is triggered, it will execute the code specified in the `index.js` file. The action can perform various tasks, such as building and testing code, deploying applications, or sending notifications.

## Example

Here is an example of a simple GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: My Action
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
          npm run test

      - name: Deploy
        uses: some-deployment-action@v1
        with:
          environment: production
```

In this example, the action is triggered whenever there is a push to the `main` branch. It runs on an Ubuntu environment and consists of three steps:

1. Checking out the code from the repository.
2. Building and testing the code using npm commands.
3. Deploying the code using a separate deployment action.

This is just a basic example, and actions can be customized to perform a wide range of tasks # GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a feature on GitHub that allows you to automate tasks and workflows in your repositories. It provides a way to create custom actions using JavaScript or by using an SDK that translates code into JavaScript.

## Creating Actions
- You can create actions using JavaScript or an SDK that translates code into JavaScript.
- The SDK allows you to write actions in .NET and then compiles them into JavaScript for GitHub Actions.

## Administrative Features
- GitHub Actions provides administrative features for organizations to control the execution of actions.
- These features allow you to decide which actions can be executed in your organization or repository.
- You can choose to allow users to use any action, whether publicly or privately available.
- You can also restrict actions to only self-developed actions or a list of actions that you decide.

Note: More details about administrative features will be covered in the demo later. # Smart Notes: Working with GitHub Actions

## Blocking the Marketplace
- Blocking the marketplace is not recommended because it restricts the available actions and limits your options.
- It is better to keep the marketplace open and perform proper code reviews for added or changed GitHub action workflows.
- This ensures that the actions used are safe and can be checked for code quality.

## Storing Actions
- Actions are typically stored in the `.github/workflows` folder in your repository.
- You can also store local actions in your own repository.
- To use a local action, save the code in your repository and reference it from there.
- Sharing actions is encouraged, so you can also use actions from other repositories.

## Recommended Approach
1. Keep the marketplace open to have access to a wide range of actions.
2. Perform code reviews for added or changed GitHub action workflows.
3. Store actions in the `.github/workflows` folder or in your own repository.
4. Share actions with others to benefit from the community's contributions. # GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a feature on GitHub that allows you to automate tasks and workflows in your repositories. It allows you to create custom actions or use pre-built actions from the GitHub community.

## Using Actions from Other Repositories

To use actions from other repositories or from other users, you can create a repository specifically for that action. For example, the structure for calling the Node.js action is `actions/setup-node`. This means that there is a user or organization on GitHub called "actions" which is the official owner of the GitHub Actions. They have created a repository called "setup-node" which contains the `actions.yaml` file and the necessary JavaScript files for that action.

To reference an action from another repository, you can use the following syntax:
```
user/organization/repository
```
You can also specify a version to consume based on tags or releases.

Keep in mind that if you decide to share your own actions, the repository must be public.

## Example

Let's say you want to use the Node.js action from the "actions/setup-node" repository in your workflow. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a new workflow file in your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`).
2. Define the workflow using the YAML syntax.
3. Use the `uses` keyword to specify the action you want to use, in this case, `actions/setup-node`.
4. Specify any inputs or parameters required by the action.
5. Add any additional steps or tasks you want to perform in the workflow.

Here's an example of a workflow that uses the Node.js action:
```yaml
name: Node.js Workflow
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '12'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build and test
      run: npm run build && npm test
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on a push event. It checks out the repository, sets up Node.js version 12 using the `actions/setup-node` action, installs dependencies, and then builds and tests the project.

By using actions from other repositories, you can easily incorporate existing workflows and automate various tasks # GitHub Actions Study Notes

## Types of Actions
- There are two types of actions that can be used in workflows:
  1. JavaScript Actions
     - Can run on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
     - Can be written in any language that compiles to JavaScript.
     - Executed in a Node.js environment.
     - Faster startup time and better user experience.
     - Code can be easily accessed in the repository.
  2. Container Actions
     - Can only run on Linux.
     - Can be written in any language.
     - Executed in a container environment.

## Repository Requirements
- Currently, there is no concept of private or internal repositories for actions.
- Actions must be associated with a public repository.

Note: The provided information is limited and may not cover all aspects of GitHub Actions. # GitHub Actions Runners and Containers

GitHub Actions runners are the containers that execute the code for GitHub Actions. They are not the code itself, but rather the environment in which the code runs. The runners can be customized to run different types of code, such as assembly language, although this is not commonly done.

## GitHub Actions Runners vs Native Actions

- GitHub Actions runners are slower compared to native actions.
- The runner needs to pull the container image from a repository, usually Docker Hub, and decompress it before executing the code.
- The startup time for runners is generally slower than native actions.
- However, runners provide more flexibility in terms of customization and execution environment.

## Running GitHub Actions Runners in Docker

It is important to note that running GitHub Actions runners inside Docker is different from using containers within the runner itself.

- Running GitHub Actions runners inside Docker will be covered later.
- This is a single action, similar to using Node.js, but with a different syntax.
- Instead of running directly on the runner, this action will spin up a container inside the runner and execute within it.

Example:
```yaml
- name: Run container action
  uses: actions/container-action@v1
  with:
    image: docker://my-container-image
```

In the above example, the action "container-action" is used to run a container image specified by "my-container-image". The code within the container will be executed within the GitHub Actions runner.

By using container actions, you can have more control over the execution environment and run code in a specific container image.

# GitHub Marketplace and Actions

## GitHub Marketplace
- GitHub Marketplace is a platform where you can find various actions for your projects.
- It includes actions from major players in the industry like Cloud Foundry, Sneak, Docker, Veracode, etc.
- These actions are categorized as first-party GitHub actions.

## GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions are automated workflows that you can set up for your projects.
- They can be used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) purposes.
- Actions can be found in the GitHub Marketplace and can be added to your workflows.

## Example of Actions
- One example of an action is an action that checks if an issue or pull request (PR) is stale.
- This action is not directly related to CI/CD but is useful for managing open source projects.
- It checks if an issue or PR has not been updated for a certain amount of time.
- If it finds any stale issues or PRs, it adds a comment and closes them.

## Benefits of the Stale Action
- The stale action is particularly useful for open source projects.
- In open source projects, issues and PRs can remain open for a long time.
- The stale action helps in identifying and managing these stale issues and PRs.
- It adds a comment to the issue or PR and closes it if necessary.

## Use Cases
- The stale action may not be as useful in an enterprise context where issues and PRs are actively managed.
- However, in open source projects, it can help in reducing clutter and maintaining a clean repository.
- It ensures that issues and PRs that have not been updated for a certain period of time are addressed or closed.

## Conclusion
- GitHub Marketplace provides a wide range of actions for various purposes.
- Actions can be used for CI/CD workflows and other project management tasks.
- The stale action is an example of an action that helps in managing open source projects by identifying and closing stale issues and PRs. # GitHub Actions

## Introduction
When working on a project, it is important to have control over the steps and actions that are performed. In traditional workflows, it can be difficult to identify what went wrong and make changes to specific actions. However, using chainable actions can provide more granular control and make customization easier.

## Traditional Workflow Challenges
In a traditional workflow:
- It is difficult to identify what went wrong and where.
- Fine control over the steps and actions is limited.
- Making changes to specific actions requires rewriting the entire workflow.

## Chainable Actions
Using chainable actions is a better approach because:
- Each action is specific and performs a single task.
- Actions can be easily customized and modified.
- It provides more granular control over the workflow.

## Example: Traditional Workflow
In a traditional workflow, the steps may be combined into a single action:
- Build
- Deploy
- Test
- API call

## Example: Chainable Actions
In a chainable action approach, each step is a separate action:
- Create draft release
- Generate release
- Add notes to release

## Benefits of Chainable Actions
Using chainable actions allows for easier customization of the workflow:
- It is easier to identify and fix issues in specific actions.
- Each action can be modified independently.
- The behavior of the workflow can be customized over time.

By using chainable actions, you have more control over the steps and actions in your workflow, making it easier to customize and modify as needed. # GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate various tasks and workflows in your software development process. It provides granular control and flexibility, allowing you to add, modify, or rollback actions as needed. Here are some key concepts to understand:

## Release Notes Generation and Addition
- GitHub Actions allows you to generate release notes for your software releases.
- You can add these release notes to the release itself.
- If any step in this process fails, you have control over which actions are affected and can keep the results of other actions in place.

## Granular Control
- With GitHub Actions, you have more control over the individual steps in your workflows.
- You can choose to fail only one piece instead of failing everything.
- This gives you the ability to handle failures more effectively and keep the results of other actions intact.

## Clear Logging
- GitHub Actions provides clearer logging for your workflows.
- You can separate the logs into different categories, making it easier to understand and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

## Starter Workflows
- When creating action workflows, you don't have to start from scratch every time.
- GitHub provides starter workflows that cover the most common operations you may want to achieve.
- These starter workflows allow you to start from a certain point and customize them to fit your specific needs.

By utilizing GitHub Actions, you can automate and streamline your software development process, saving time and effort. # GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a feature on GitHub that allows you to automate tasks and workflows within your repository. It provides pre-configured workflows for different languages, frameworks, and third-party providers like Azure and AWS. You can also create your own custom workflows as templates.

## Creating a New Action

To create a new action, you have two options:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` folder in your repository and add a YAML file to it.
2. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository and click on "New workflow".

## Workflow Templates

When creating a new workflow, GitHub provides you with a list of workflow templates to choose from. These templates are suggested based on the language, frameworks, or files in your repository. However, if you don't have any specific templates available, you can create your own custom workflow.

## Example

Let's go through a quick demo of creating a new action using a workflow template:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository.
2. Click on "New workflow".
3. Choose a workflow template from the available options.
4. Customize the template according to your needs.
5. Save the workflow file.

By following these steps, you can easily create a new action using a pre-configured workflow template or create your own custom workflow. # GitHub Templates for .NET Applications

GitHub provides suggested templates for .NET applications based on the content of your repository. These templates are a good starting point to understand the operations you can perform using pre-defined templates. While the suggestions may not always be accurate, they provide a useful guide for available options.

## Types of Templates
- Dotnet: Templates specifically designed for .NET applications.
- Dotnet Desktop: Templates for desktop applications built using .NET.
- Node.js: Templates for deploying Node.js applications to Azure.
- Alibaba Cloud: Templates for deploying applications to Alibaba Cloud's ECS.

## Non-CI/CD Templates
Apart from CI/CD templates, GitHub also offers templates for non-CI/CD related tasks. Some examples include:
- Sending greetings automatically.
- Applying labels automatically to your issues.

These templates can help automate certain tasks and improve efficiency in managing your repository. # GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a feature on GitHub that allows you to automate tasks and workflows. It provides a way to check for stale issues, NPRs (non-public records), and perform actions such as marking them, closing them, or sending comments. These actions are performed for free and can be accessed by clicking on the "Setup Workflow" button.

## Using GitHub Actions

To use GitHub Actions, you can either access it on GitHub itself or use the VS Code extension. The GitHub interface provides a marketplace where you can search for tasks and actions.

## Workflow Structure

The structure of a workflow file in GitHub Actions is as follows:

- Name: Specifies the name of the workflow.
- Events: Defines the events that trigger the workflow.
- Jobs: Contains one or more jobs that need to be executed.

## Creating a Simple Workflow

To demonstrate the functionality of GitHub Actions, we will create a basic workflow. Here are the steps:

1. Access the GitHub Actions interface.
2. Click on the "Setup Workflow" button.
3. This will generate a YAML file with the necessary instructions for your desired workflow.

Note: The structure of the YAML file is similar to what we have seen before, with a name, events, and job section.

## Additional Information

- GitHub Actions can be accessed on GitHub itself or through the VS Code extension.
- The marketplace in GitHub Actions allows you to search for tasks and actions.
- Workflows in GitHub Actions consist of a name, events, and one or more jobs.
- The "Setup Workflow" button generates a YAML file with instructions for your desired workflow. # GitHub Actions Study Notes

## Introduction to GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions is a feature on GitHub that allows you to automate tasks and workflows.
- It uses jobs and runners to execute these tasks.
- Jobs are the individual units of work that you want to perform.
- Runners are the machines or environments where the jobs are executed.

## GitHub Hosted Runners
- GitHub provides hosted runners, which are machines that run your jobs.
- These runners are hosted on the GitHub infrastructure, so you don't have to worry about managing the infrastructure yourself.
- The runners are pre-configured with different operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.
- You can choose the appropriate runner for your job based on your requirements.

## Steps in a GitHub Action Workflow
- Steps are the individual actions that are performed within a job.
- Each step is a separate task that contributes to the overall workflow.
- Steps can be used to perform various operations, such as building code, running tests, or deploying applications.
- To access the code in your repository, you can use the `actions/checkout` task, which downloads the repository content to the current workspace.

## Adding Tasks to a GitHub Action Workflow
- To add tasks to your GitHub Action workflow, you can search for the specific task you want to perform.
- For example, if you want to set up Node.js, you can search for "setup Node.js" and find the appropriate task.
- Similarly, you can search for other tasks like "setup .NET" to find tasks related to .NET development.
- GitHub provides a wide range of pre-defined tasks that you can use in your workflows.

## Marking the End of a Line
- In the provided notes, there is a mention of "this mark" without further context.
- It is unclear what this refers to, as the notes do not provide any additional information.

Please note that the provided notes are concise and may not cover all the details of GitHub Actions. It is recommended to refer to the official GitHub Actions documentation for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. # GitHub Actions Verification and Usage

GitHub Actions are verified by GitHub, providing a higher level of confidence, especially for enterprise customers. Third-party companies can also be verified, ensuring the reliability of their actions.

To add an action to your workflow:
1. Click on the desired action.
2. Choose the version you want (latest version is recommended).
3. Copy the code.
4. Paste the code into your GitHub Actions workflow file.

YAML formatting is important, so ensure that the code is properly formatted.

## Benefits of Using GitHub Actions Online
- Automatic linting of code and parameters.
- Immediate feedback on missing or incomplete parameters.
- Red highlighting indicates missing parameters, which disappears once filled in.

Example:
```yaml
name: My Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run tests
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 14
      # ... additional steps
```

In the example above, the workflow is triggered on a push event to the main branch. The job "build" runs on an Ubuntu environment. The steps include checking out the code and running tests using Node.js version 14.

# GitHub Actions Study Notes

## Marketplace Page
- The marketplace page provides instructions on how to use specific actions.
- It gives additional information on how to use a specific piece of action.
- It also provides a link to the actual repository where the action is stored.

## Adding a Task
- Apart from adding a task, you can also have multiple jobs.
- Each job must have a "runs on" field, which is mandatory.
- Multiple jobs run simultaneously.
- This can be useful when different jobs perform different tasks.

## Running Actions in Parallel
- If you have multiple jobs, they will run in parallel.
- This means that they will run at the same time.
- This can be beneficial when the jobs perform different tasks.

## Example:
```yaml
name: Example Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build project
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
In this example, there are two jobs: "build" and "test". They both run on the latest version of Ubuntu. The "build" job checks out the code, installs dependencies, and builds the project. The "test" job checks out the code and runs the tests. Both jobs run simultaneously when the workflow is triggered. # GitHub Actions Study Notes

## Dependencies and Chaining Jobs
- Jobs in GitHub Actions can depend on one another and can be completed independently.
- To chain jobs, use the `needs` keyword followed by the name of the other job.
- For example, a test job can wait for the build job to succeed before starting.
- More information can be found in the action documentation.

## Nesting in Azure Pipelines
- In Azure Pipelines, there are three layers of nesting: tasks, jobs, and stages.
- Tasks are the individual steps within a job.
- Jobs can have multiple steps.
- Stages are not present in GitHub Actions, only jobs and steps exist.

Note: The concept of stages is specific to Azure Pipelines and is not available in GitHub Actions. # GitHub Actions and Job Visualization

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration (CI) system that allows you to automate your software development workflows. In GitHub Actions, jobs are the equivalent of stages in other CI systems. Each job represents a specific task or set of tasks that need to be executed.

## Job Visualization

GitHub Actions introduced a job visualization feature last year. This feature allows you to visualize the entire workflow, which can be helpful when your GitHub Action performs multiple tasks in different environments.

- The job visualization feature is useful when your GitHub Action has multiple jobs that need to be executed in a specific order.
- It provides a clear overview of the workflow and helps you understand the sequence of tasks.

## Jobs in GitHub Actions

In GitHub Actions, jobs are individual units of work that can be run in parallel or sequentially. Each job can be composed of multiple steps, which are the actual tasks that need to be executed.

- Jobs in GitHub Actions can be concatenated with others, allowing you to create complex workflows.
- Jobs can be run in parallel, which can help speed up the execution of your workflows.

## Differences from Other CI Systems

GitHub Actions has some differences compared to other CI systems, such as Jenkins or pipelines in other platforms.

- In GitHub Actions, jobs are used instead of stages to represent different tasks or sets of tasks.
- Each job can be run independently and can be concatenated with other jobs to create a workflow.
- The job visualization feature in GitHub Actions provides a way to visualize the entire workflow, which can be helpful when dealing with complex workflows.

## Example

Here is an example of a GitHub Action workflow:

- Job 1: Build
  - This job is responsible for building the software.
  - It can include steps like compiling code, running tests, and generating artifacts.

- Job 2: Deploy to Staging
  - This job deploys the built software to a staging environment.
  - It can include steps like deploying to a staging server and running integration tests.

- Job 3: Deploy to Dev
  - This job deploys the built software to a development environment.
  - It can include steps like deploying to a development server and running additional tests.

- Job 4: Deploy to Production
  - This job deploys the built software to a production environment.
  - It can include steps like deploying to a production server and performing final checks.

By using jobs in GitHub Actions, you can create a workflow that builds the software, # Governance around Actions

## Introduction to Governance
Governance refers to the rules and policies that govern the use of actions in a repository or at an organizational level. It allows you to control and manage the actions that can be used within your project.

## Repository-level Governance
At the repository level, you can configure the governance settings for actions. To access these settings, go to the "Settings" tab in your repository and navigate to the "Actions" menu.

## Configuring Actions
Within the Actions menu, you have several options to configure the actions for your repository:

- Disable Actions: You can choose to disable actions completely for this repository. However, it is generally not recommended to disable actions as they provide valuable automation capabilities.

- Local Actions: Enabling only local actions means that only actions created by the user can be used within the repository. This restricts the usage of actions to custom-defined actions specific to the repository.

- Custom Actions: You can create a list of actions that users can search and use to create their own actions. This allows for more flexibility and collaboration within the repository.

- Enable All Actions: Enabling all actions allows users to use any action available in the GitHub Actions marketplace. This provides the most extensive range of pre-built actions that can be utilized within the repository.

## Benefits of Governance
Implementing governance around actions offers several benefits:

- Control: Governance allows you to have control over the actions that can be used within your repository. This ensures that only approved and trusted actions are utilized.

- Security: By configuring governance settings, you can mitigate security risks associated with using unverified or malicious actions. This helps protect your repository and its workflows.

- Consistency: Governance promotes consistency by enforcing the use of standardized actions across the repository. This ensures that all actions follow the same guidelines and best practices.

- Collaboration: With governance, you can enable collaboration by allowing users to create and share their own actions within the repository. This fosters a sense of community and encourages the reuse of actions.

## Conclusion
Governance around actions provides a way to control and manage the usage of actions within a repository. By configuring the governance settings, you can ensure the security, consistency, and collaboration of actions in your project. # GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful feature on GitHub that allows users to automate tasks and workflows directly within their repositories. It provides a flexible way to execute actions created by verified creators or even third-party/community actions.

## Enabling Actions

To enable Actions for a repository, you can go to the repository's settings and navigate to the "Actions" tab. Here, you can enable Actions for the repository.

## Organization Level Actions

In an organization context, you can also enable Actions at the organization level. This allows you to have consistent settings across all repositories within the organization. When enabling Actions at the organization level, you have the option to apply these settings to all repositories or only to specific repositories.

## Disabling Actions

If needed, you can disable Actions for a repository. In the repository settings, you can find the option to disable Actions. This can be useful if you want to temporarily stop the execution of workflows or if you no longer need Actions for a specific repository.

## Artifact Log Retention

GitHub Actions allows you to retain artifacts and logs generated during the execution of workflows. You can configure the retention period for these artifacts and logs. This can be helpful for auditing purposes or for accessing historical data.

## Self-Hosted Runners

GitHub Actions also supports self-hosted runners. These runners are machines that you can set up and manage within your own infrastructure. They can be used to run workflows and actions on your own hardware. Self-hosted runners provide more control and flexibility, especially for organizations that have specific security or compliance requirements.

## Summary

- GitHub Actions allows users to automate tasks and workflows within repositories.
- Actions can be enabled at the repository level or at the organization level.
- Actions can be disabled if needed.
- Artifact log retention allows you to retain artifacts and logs generated during workflow execution.
- Self-hosted runners provide more control and flexibility for running workflows on your own infrastructure. # Troubleshooting Workflows and Best Practices for Actions

## Workflow Troubleshooting
- The workflow editor online provides automatic linting and hints for any potential problems in the workflow.
- If you see a red squiggle under any action, it indicates that there may be an issue.
- Checking the log is another way to troubleshoot workflows, but sometimes the log may not provide clear information about what went wrong.
- Action debugging can be used to dig deeper into the actions and identify any issues.

## Action Troubleshooting
- When using predefined actions or creating custom actions, troubleshooting may be necessary.
- The workflow editor online and the log can help identify issues with actions.
- If the log does not provide clear information, additional troubleshooting steps can be taken.
- Here are some ways to troubleshoot actions:
  - Review the action's code and configuration to ensure it is set up correctly.
  - Check for any errors or warnings in the log related to the action.
  - Test the action in isolation to see if it works correctly outside of the workflow.
  - Use the GitHub Actions Toolkit to debug actions by adding console.log statements to the code and checking the output in the log.
  - Reach out to the GitHub community or support for assistance if needed.

## Best Practices for Creating and Using Actions
- When creating actions, it is important to follow best practices to ensure they are effective and reliable.
- Here are some best practices for creating and using actions:
  - Keep actions small and focused on a specific task to make them reusable and easier to maintain.
  - Use descriptive names for actions to make it clear what they do.
  - Include clear documentation and instructions on how to use the action.
  - Test actions thoroughly before using them in workflows to ensure they work as expected.
  - Version control actions to track changes and easily roll back if needed.
  - Consider using action templates or starter kits to streamline the creation process.
  - Regularly review and update actions to incorporate any improvements or bug fixes.
  - Share actions with the GitHub community to contribute and help others.

By following these troubleshooting techniques and best practices, you can effectively troubleshoot workflows and create reliable actions for your GitHub projects. # Debugging in GitHub Actions

## Introduction
Debugging is an essential part of troubleshooting and identifying issues in GitHub Actions workflows. By enabling debugging features, you can gather more information about the actions and steps being executed, which can help in identifying and resolving problems.

## Step Debugging
Step debugging allows you to gather information specifically about the actions and steps in your workflow. By setting the `actions_step_debug` secret to `true`, you can enable step debugging. This will provide you with detailed logs that can help you understand what each action and step is doing.

To enable step debugging:
1. Set the `actions_step_debug` secret to `true`.
2. Check the logs for lines containing `::debug::`. These lines will provide additional information about the actions and steps.

## Runner Debugging
Runner debugging provides information about the runner itself. This can be useful if you suspect that the issue lies with the runner environment rather than the actions or steps.

To enable runner debugging:
1. Set the `runner_debug` secret to `true`.
2. Check the logs for lines containing `::debug::`. These lines will provide additional information about the runner.

## Using Secrets
In GitHub Actions, secrets can be used to store sensitive information such as API keys, access tokens, or passwords. These secrets can then be accessed within your workflows.

To use secrets in GitHub Actions:
1. Set the desired secrets in your repository settings.
2. Access the secrets using the `secrets` context in your workflow.

Example:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Use a secret
    run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
```

## Environment Variables
Environment variables can be used to store and access information within your workflows. They can be set globally or within specific steps.

To use environment variables in GitHub Actions:
1. Set the desired environment variables in your workflow.
2. Access the environment variables using the `$` syntax.

Example:
```yaml
env:
  MY_VARIABLE: "Hello, World!"

steps:
  - name: Use an environment variable
    run: echo $MY_VARIABLE
```

## Conclusion
Debugging in GitHub Actions is crucial for identifying and resolving issues in your workflows. By enabling step debugging and runner debugging, you can gather more information about the actions, steps, and runner environment. Additionally, secrets and environment variables can be used to store and access sensitive information and configuration values within your workflows. # GitHub Actions Debugging

## Usual Logs and Workflow Editor
- The usual way to view logs in GitHub Actions is through the logs window.
- The workflow editor also provides a way to view logs.

## Enabling `actions_runner_debug`
- If the usual logs are not sufficient, you can enable `actions_runner_debug`.
- This allows you to see the logs at the runner level.
- Enabling this is rarely necessary, especially with hosted runners.
- It can be useful if you suspect infrastructure-related issues causing your action to fail.

## Viewing Logs with `actions_runner_debug`
- Enabling `actions_runner_debug` does not show the logs directly in the logs window.
- Instead, it instructs the GitHub Actions engine to save log files in a runner diagnostic directory in the log archive.
- The log archive can be downloaded by clicking on the ellipsis (...) on the upper right of your GitHub Actions workflow execution panel.
- In the log archive, you will find the diagnostic runner directory.

Note: Remember to disable `actions_runner_debug` after debugging to avoid unnecessary log files. # GitHub Actions Study Notes

The Workflow Editor and the GitHub Actions Marketplace provide user-friendly interfaces to create and customize your workflows. Additionally, the VS Code extension and the Nectos/act project offer alternative ways to write, debug, and run your workflows. # Debugging and Troubleshooting Actions

When creating actions for yourself or clients, it is important to follow best practices for debugging and troubleshooting. Here are some key points to consider:

## Versioning
- When consuming an action, you are consuming a specific version of the action (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
- It is recommended to document and label the versions of your actions so that users can consume the desired version.
- Whenever you make changes to an action, create a new version.
- Not creating a new version for changes can impact users who are already using the action.
- Changes in behavior can cause the action to stop working for existing users.

Example:
- If you have hundreds of users using an action and you make a change that affects its behavior, not creating a new version can cause the action to stop working for all those users.

## Ripple Effect
- Changes made to an action can have a ripple effect on other parts of the system.
- It is important to consider how changes in one action can impact other actions or components that rely on it.
- Testing the impact of changes thoroughly can help identify and resolve any issues before they affect users.

Example:
- If a change in one action causes a chain reaction that affects other actions, it can disrupt the functionality of the entire system.

## Testing and Validation
- Before deploying an action, it is crucial to thoroughly test and validate its functionality.
- Testing should cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the action performs as expected.
- Validation can involve manual testing, automated testing, and user feedback.

Example:
- Testing an action with various inputs and verifying the output can help identify any bugs or unexpected behavior.

## Error Handling
- Implementing proper error handling in actions is essential for providing a good user experience.
- Actions should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- Error handling can include catching exceptions, logging errors, and providing troubleshooting guidance.

Example:
- If an action encounters an error, it should display a clear error message to the user, explaining what went wrong and how to resolve it.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Logging and monitoring actions can help track their performance and identify any issues or bottlenecks.
- Logging can provide valuable insights into the execution flow and help debug problems.
- Monitoring can involve tracking metrics such as response time, error rate, and resource usage.

Example:
- By monitoring an action's response time, you can identify if it is taking

# Smart Study Notes: Versioning, Documentation, and CI/CD with GitHub

## Versioning
- Always include documentation for your actions, whether you're working in an open-source or inner-source context.
- Documentation helps understand the parameters, variables, and functionality of an action.
- Create unit tests for your actions to facilitate troubleshooting, debugging, and maintenance.
- Maintain the metadata in the action.yaml file to keep it up to date with any changes or differences in your action.

## Documentation
- Documentation is essential for understanding the usage and functionality of an action.
- It helps users know what parameters and variables are required for the action.
- Proper documentation is crucial for actions that may not have immediate usage.
- Include information on what the action does and any specific instructions or examples.

## Unit Tests
- Creating unit tests for your actions is highly recommended.
- Unit tests make it easier to identify and fix issues in your code.
- They help ensure that your action functions as intended.
- Unit tests can be used for troubleshooting, debugging, and maintaining the action.

## Metadata
- The action.yaml file contains metadata that defines the properties and behavior of an action.
- It is important to keep the metadata up to date with any changes or differences in your action.
- The metadata includes information such as the name, description, inputs, outputs, and runs properties of the action.
- Maintaining accurate metadata helps users understand and use your action correctly.

## CI/CD with GitHub
- GitHub provides features for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- CI/CD helps automate the build, test, and deployment processes of your code.
- It ensures that changes to your code are tested and deployed in a controlled and efficient manner.
- GitHub Actions can be used to set up CI/CD workflows for your projects.
- CI/CD workflows can be customized to fit your specific requirements and can include steps such as building, testing, and deploying your code.

Note: The provided notes have been transformed into concise study notes, focusing on the main concepts and key points. # Continuous Integration (CI)
- CI is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository.
- It helps to catch bugs and conflicts early by automatically building and testing the code.
- CI ensures that the codebase is always in a working state and ready for deployment.

## CI Workflow with GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform provided by GitHub.
- It allows you to automate your CI workflows and perform various tasks.
- In this example, we have a CI workflow with a single job consisting of four steps.
- The job can be expanded to include multiple jobs for different purposes like testing.
- All the actions in the workflow are chained and composed as separate steps of the job.

## Matrix in CI
- In the CI workflow, we can have a matrix that runs multiple jobs with different configurations.
- The matrix helps to ensure that the application works against different versions of Node.js or other parameters.
- Each job in the matrix is executed separately, but all are contained within the CI context.

## Example: Node.js Application CI Workflow
1. Installing Dependencies:
   - This step installs the necessary dependencies for the Node.js application.
   - It ensures that all the required packages are available for the subsequent steps.

2. Running CI:
   - This step runs the CI process for the Node.js application.
   - It includes tasks like linting, formatting, and other code quality checks.
   - The purpose is to ensure that the code adheres to the defined standards.

3. Executing Tests:
   - This step runs the tests for the Node.js application.
   - It verifies the functionality and correctness of the code.
   - The tests help to catch any bugs or issues in the application.

4. Uploading Artifacts:
   - This step uploads the test results as an artifact.
   - Artifacts are files or data generated during the CI process.
   - They can be used for further analysis or as evidence of the CI execution.

Note: The example provided is specific to a Node.js application, but the concept of CI and the workflow structure can be applied to other types of applications as well. # Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Systems

## Main Difference of the CI/CD System
- The main difference of this CI/CD system compared to others on the market is that it can only download artifacts from the current workflow.
- To use an artifact from another workflow, a community action needs to be used.

## Actions in CI/CD Systems
- The checkout action is essential for CI as it allows you to use the files in your repository.
- It clones the repository in the current runner and allows you to work on those files.

## Setting Up Language in CI Workflow
- In a CI setup or CI workflow, it is important to set up the language you will be using.
- For example, in this case, the language being used is node.js. # Smart Study Notes - Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

## Introduction to GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows. It provides a way to define custom actions and triggers based on events in your repository.

## Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository. This helps in detecting and resolving integration issues early on.

## Setting up CI with GitHub Actions
To set up CI with GitHub Actions, you need to define a workflow file in your repository. This file contains the steps and actions that will be executed when certain events occur.

## Workflow File Structure
A workflow file consists of the following components:
- Name: A descriptive name for your workflow.
- On: The event that triggers the workflow.
- Jobs: The list of jobs to be executed in the workflow.

## Jobs and Steps
A job is a set of steps that are executed on the same runner. Each step represents a single task that needs to be performed.

## Actions in GitHub Actions
Actions are reusable units of code that can be used in your workflows. They can be created by the community or by yourself. Actions can be used to perform various tasks, such as building and testing your code.

## Using Actions for Language and Framework Setup
GitHub Actions provides an action called "setup" that allows you to ensure the right version of your language or framework is present on the runner. This action checks if the language or framework is already installed and sets any necessary environment variables. If the language or framework is not installed, the action will download and install it.

## Uploading Artifacts
After building your application, it is often useful to upload the artifacts to GitHub. This allows you to easily access and share the built files. Uploading artifacts can be done using the "upload-artifact" action provided by GitHub Actions.

## Conclusion
GitHub Actions provides a powerful and flexible way to set up continuous integration workflows for your projects. By defining workflows and utilizing actions, you can automate various tasks and ensure the smooth development of your software. # Continuous Integration (CI) and GitHub

## Uploading Build Results to GitHub
- After building your project, you can upload the result to GitHub.
- This allows you to have a backup of your files and easily download them.
- The result is stored as a zip file.
- You can verify that all the files are present in the zip file.
- This is done using the "upload artifact" action.
- The artifact store is provided by GitHub and is stored on the same infrastructure.
- If you are using GitHub Enterprise Server, the action will save the artifact on the server's VM or machine.

## Using a Linter
- It is recommended to use a linter if you don't have any other linter in place.
- A linter is a piece of code that checks the correctness of your code based on certain rules.
- It can be used for programming languages, scripting, and more. # Main Topic: GitHub Super Linter

## What is a linter?
A linter is a tool that enforces coding rules and standards for a specific programming language. It helps ensure that code is written in a consistent and error-free manner.

## Linters for specific languages
- Each programming language typically has its own linter.
- For example, there are linters for JavaScript, C#, Java, etc.
- These linters are specifically designed to check code written in their respective languages.

## GitHub Super Linter
- GitHub Super Linter is a powerful tool that combines multiple linters into one.
- It can be used for various types of code, including scripting code and infrastructure code (e.g., YAML, Ansible, ARM templates).
- With just a few lines of YAML configuration, you can use GitHub Super Linter for any code in your repository.

## How GitHub Super Linter works
- GitHub Super Linter scans the content of your repository after performing a checkout.
- It identifies the different types of files in your repository.
- It then uses the specific linter for each type of file to check for coding errors and enforce coding standards.

## Benefits of GitHub Super Linter
- Simplified setup: With only a few lines of YAML configuration, you can use GitHub Super Linter for any code in your repository.
- Comprehensive coverage: GitHub Super Linter supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, ensuring that all types of code are covered.
- Consistent coding standards: GitHub Super Linter enforces coding rules and standards, helping maintain consistency across your codebase.

## Customization options
- GitHub Super Linter offers a range of customization options.
- These options allow you to configure the linter to suit your specific needs.
- However, the details of customization are not covered in these notes.

For more information on customization options, please refer to the documentation provided by GitHub Super Linter. # GitHub Actions for Deployment

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for linting and deploying code. It can be used for various purposes, such as deploying to development, QA, testing, or production environments. It is important to note that GitHub Actions is not only a CI (Continuous Integration) tool but also a fully-fledged CD (Continuous Deployment) engine.

## CI and CD in GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions is known for its strong CI capabilities.
- In the past, its CD capabilities were not as mature.
- However, in recent months, GitHub Actions has improved significantly in terms of deployment.
- It is now considered a reliable option even for enterprise clients.

## Sample CD Workflow for Container Images

- This example demonstrates a CD workflow for storing container images.
- It is the final step of a CI job.
- The goal is to store the Docker image in packages.
- The workflow consists of two jobs: storing the image and deploying to Azure.

### Storing the Image

- This job is responsible for storing the Docker image.
- The image is stored in packages.
- Packages are a feature of GitHub Actions that will be discussed further.

### Deploying to Azure

- This job is responsible for deploying the stored image to Azure.
- It utilizes the "needs" keyword, which allows one job to depend on the completion of another job.
- In this case, the deployment job depends on the completion of the image storage job. # Deployment Process

## Azure Deployment
- Login to Azure
- Login to Docker repo
- Deploy the container

## Other Cloud Providers
- Can also perform deployment on other cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Alibaba

## Uploading Artifact
- Use the "upload artifact" action
- Takes all files in the public folder and zips them
- Makes the artifact available to other jobs in the same workflow

## Downloading Artifact
- In the deploy job, use the "download artifact" step
- Downloads the artifact with the same name as the one created
- Makes it available in the public folder (if no path is specified, it will put it in the root) # Deploying to Container Service

To deploy to a container service, you need to follow these steps:

1. Set the working directory to the workspace.
2. Use the files in the workspace for deployment and other tasks.
3. This approach can be used not only for deployments but also for other jobs like artifact analysis or sending emails with zip files.
   - Note: Sending emails is just an example and may not be recommended.
4. For deploying to the Amazon Container Service, follow these steps:
   - Create the image and save it in a designated location, such as the "packages" folder.
   - Use the image to deploy to Amazon.
   - This process can be repeated for other container services as well, as we can deploy to any Kubernetes-based platform. # Deployment Environments in GitHub Actions

## Overview
Deployment environments in GitHub Actions are a logical representation of your environments, such as dev, QA, and production. They allow you to define and manage the deployment of your applications or projects to specific environments. 

## Environment Slices
In GitHub Actions, deployment environments are typically represented as slices of the whole environment. This means that you can define and deploy only the specific components or resources that are required for a particular repository, application, or project. For example, you can deploy only the Azure Web App or Kubernetes cluster needed for the development environment, rather than the entire environment.

## Secrets and Protection Rules
Deployment environments in GitHub Actions have the ability to define their own secrets. Secrets are sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens, that are required for the deployment process. By defining secrets within the deployment environment, you can securely store and access them during the deployment process.

Additionally, deployment environments have protection rules. These rules allow you to enforce certain controls and restrictions on the deployment process. One important protection rule is the ability to define required reviewers. This means that before a deployment can be executed, it must be reviewed and approved by the specified reviewers. This helps ensure that only authorized individuals can initiate deployments.

## Summary
- Deployment environments in GitHub Actions are a logical representation of your environments.
- They allow you to deploy specific components or resources to a particular environment.
- Deployment environments can define their own secrets for secure storage and access.
- Protection rules, such as required reviewers, provide control and approval for deployments.


# Deployment Management
Deployment management involves the approval and execution of deploying a project or application to a specific environment. It typically requires a project manager or deployment manager to click on the deploy button to initiate the deployment process.

## Protection Rules for Environments
- Weight Timers: Allows for a specified amount of time to pass before the deployment is actually executed in the environment. This can be set in minutes or seconds.
- Allowed Branches for Deployment: Specifies which branches are allowed to be deployed. This is useful in enterprise contexts where deployments may only be allowed from specific release branches.

## Third-Party Integrations
- APIs: Deployment management systems often provide APIs that allow for third-party integrations. These integrations can be used to simulate the functionality of gates, similar to what is done in Azure DevOps.
- Gates: Gates are used to ensure that an application is deployed correctly. They can be set up to perform certain checks or actions before allowing the deployment to proceed. # GitHub Protection Rules and Third-Party Integrations

GitHub provides protection rules and allows integration with third-party products and services for enhanced security. These integrations can scan your environments and provide reports through APIs for review and approval or denial of deployments. Although this feature is still a work in progress and not yet available for use, it will involve making APIs accessible for third-party integrations.

## Deployment Logs

GitHub also offers deployment logs, which can be for a single environment or multiple environments simultaneously. These logs provide a comprehensive history of deployments, including the date and user responsible for each deployment.

Key points about deployment logs:

- Deployment logs are available for both single and multiple environments.
- They offer a complete history of deployments.
- Each deployment is associated with a specific date and user.

Example:
- Deployment Log for Single Environment:
  - Date: January 1, 2022
  - User: JohnDoe
- Deployment Log for Multiple Environments:
  - Date: January 2, 2022
  - User: JaneSmith

By utilizing deployment logs, users can track and monitor the deployment history of their projects. # Deployment Status
## Production
- Active version: [version name]
- Other active versions: [version names]
## Staging
- Waiting state: [branch name]
- Superseded version: [version name]
- Active version: [version name]

# Creating Environments
Environments can be created at the repo or organization level. 
- Environments are available in public repositories and in private repositories for Enterprise Cloud users.
- Environments are not available in private repositories for non-Enterprise Cloud users.
- To create environments, go to the settings of your repo or organization.
- In the settings, navigate to the "Environments" section.
- Click on "Create Environment" to create a new environment. # Environments
- Development
- Production
- Staging

## Creating a New Environment
- Click on "Configure Environment"
- This will bring you to the environment configuration page
- You can also use this page to edit existing environments

## Configuring Protection Rules
- Required Reviewers: Add up to six reviewers (users or teams) who can approve a specific deployment in a specific environment
- Search for the name of the user or team within your organization
- Wait Timer: Specify the wait time in minutes before the deployment can be approved
- Deployment Branches: Specify the branches from which the deployment should be limited
  - By default, all branches are allowed
  - You can choose protected branches using branch policies
  - You can also select specific branches # Deployment and Environments

## Deployment from Release Branches
- Deployment can be done from release branches.
- Pattern matching can be used to add rules to the deployment.

## Environments
- Environments can have their own secrets.
- Environments are defined using YAML.
- Each environment is given a name that must match the name in the settings.
- The environment section is added inside the job.
- The environment section includes the name of the environment.
- The environment section can also include a URL.
  - The URL can be hardcoded or dynamically created using output parameters from other jobs. # Action Visualization

In the action visualization, the URL that specifies a parameter is shown inside the visualization. By clicking on the link, you can be brought to the environment or application that you have deployed. The URL must start with either "http" or "https" and can be a domain name, host name, or IP address.

Advantages of using this feature:
- Easy access to the deployed environment or application by clicking on the link in the visualization.
- The home page of your repository will have a new box that lists all your environments in the deployment order, with the latest deployment at the top.
- Each environment in the list will have a state indicating the current status of the deployment.

Note: The action visualization also provides other features such as secrets and rules, but these were not discussed in the provided notes. # Environment
- An environment can be active, inactive, or waiting.
- Active means that something is being deployed to that environment.
- Inactive means that nothing is being deployed to that environment yet or the deployment is being reverted back.
- Waiting means that the environment is waiting for approval.

## Environment Dashboard
- Clicking on an environment gives access to the environment dashboard.
- The environment dashboard provides the latest state for each environment.
- It also includes an activity log.

## Activity Log
- The activity log shows the activity for either all environments or a specific environment.
- It provides information about the actions taken in the environment.
- It can be used to track the progress of deployments.

## View Deployment Button
- The environment dashboard includes a "View Deployment" button.
- This button takes the URL specified for that environment and allows you to visit the page or service associated with it.

## Example: Production Environment Waiting
- In the example, the production environment is in a waiting state.
- To understand why it is waiting, you can go to the action workflow that triggered the deployment.
- In this case, the deployment is waiting for review.
- If you are part of the reviewer team, you can see this information.
- If you are not part of the reviewer team, you would not be able to see it. # Smart Notes: GitHub Actions and Self-Hosted Runners

## GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions allow for automated workflows and tasks within a GitHub repository.
- Actions can be triggered by events such as push, pull request, or schedule.
- Actions can be used to build, test, and deploy applications.

## Deployment Approval
- When a deployment is triggered, it can be approved or rejected.
- Meaningful comments should be used when approving or rejecting a deployment.
- GitHub Actions will deploy the application once the approval is given.

## Self-Hosted Runners
- Self-hosted runners are an alternative to using GitHub's hosted runners.
- With self-hosted runners, the user is responsible for updates, maintenance, and management.
- Hosted runners are always clean instances, while self-hosted runners retain their state.

## Main Differences
- GitHub takes care of updates, maintenance, and management for hosted runners.
- Self-hosted runners require the user to handle updates, maintenance, and management.
- Hosted runners are always clean instances, while self-hosted runners retain their state.

Note: The original notes were not clear on the differences between hosted and self-hosted runners. # Self-Hosted Runners vs Hosted Runners

## Self-Hosted Runners
- You are responsible for the maintenance and updates of the self-hosted runner.
- You can use your own infrastructure on-premises or in the cloud.
- Any costs associated with the infrastructure are your responsibility.
- You have full control over the runner and can customize it to your needs.
- You can create a script to automatically update the self-hosted runner application.
- There is a grant of means of execution included in your licenses.
- If you exceed the grant, you will need to pay for the extra minutes of execution.

## Hosted Runners
- The maintenance and updates of the hosted runner are taken care of by GitHub.
- You don't need to worry about infrastructure or updates.
- The runner is automatically updated by the script provided by GitHub.
- You are responsible for everything else, such as your code and dependencies.
- The pricing for hosted runners is based on the plan you choose.
- You have a certain amount of minutes of execution included in your plan.
- If you exceed the included minutes, you will need to pay for the extra minutes.

Note: The information provided here is based on the student's notes and may not cover all aspects of self-hosted and hosted runners. # Self-Hosted Runners for GitHub Actions

## Customization Capabilities
- Self-hosted runners allow for much more customization capabilities.
- You can install whatever you want on your machine and prepare it as you wish.
- You have control over permissions and network connections.

## Not Recommended for Public Repositories
- It is not recommended to use self-hosted runners for public repositories.
- Public repositories are by definition public, so there is a risk of third-party users leveraging the features of your application or the features installed on your runner to penetrate your network or firewall.
- To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to set up IP allow lists or stronger firewall policies.

## Reasons to Use Self-Hosted Runners
- If you have to use self-hosted runners for any reason, consider the following:
  - Working on an application that requires specific configurations or dependencies that are not available on the GitHub-hosted runners.
  - Needing to access resources or services that are only available within your network.
  - Requiring faster or more powerful hardware than what is provided by the GitHub-hosted runners.

## Conclusion
- Self-hosted runners provide more customization capabilities but come with security risks.
- It is not recommended to use self-hosted runners for public repositories.
- If you have to use self-hosted runners, take necessary precautions to protect your network and resources.

# Using GPU Computation with Self-Hosted Runners

To use GPU for your application in GitHub Actions, you will need to use self-hosted runners since GitHub does not provide GPU-hosted runners at the moment. Configuring a self-hosted runner is easy using the GitHub interface. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to the GitHub interface and find the scripts provided for setting up a self-hosted runner.
2. Execute the scripts on the machine you want to dedicate as a self-hosted runner.
3. Start the configuration process and use the Personal Access Token generator from GitHub to authenticate the runner against your instance, organization, or repository.
4. Once the configuration is complete, the self-hosted runner will register itself on your repository or organization and start listening for jobs.

Keep in mind that with self-hosted runners, you are responsible for maintenance and installation of dependencies. This means that you will need to handle the installation of any required dependencies yourself.

For example, if you need to work on a .NET application, you will need to ensure that the .NET framework is installed on the machine where the self-hosted runner is running.

It's important to note that GitHub Actions does not provide GPU-hosted runners at the moment, so using self-hosted runners is the only way to utilize GPU computation in GitHub Actions. # Smart Notes: Runner Groups in Node.js

## Overview
- Runner groups in Node.js are used to group pools of runners together for specific purposes.
- They can be used to scope runners to specific organizations or repositories, or for specific technologies.
- Runner groups help prevent conflicts between different teams or applications.
- Runners can be moved between groups, but each runner can only be in one group at a time.

## Installation and Updates
- The framework is installed on the runner.
- It is used for all different applications, frameworks, and dependencies.
- It is important to keep the framework updated manually.
- Regularly check for updates and install them to ensure optimal performance.

## Creating Runner Groups
- Runner groups allow you to group pools of runners together.
- They can be created to scope runners to specific organizations or repositories.
- For example, you can have one group of runners for Team A and another group for Team B.
- This helps prevent conflicts between different teams or applications.
- Runner groups can also be created for specific technologies or requirements.
- For example, you can have a group of runners with GPUs or a group with high memory capacity.
- You can even have separate groups for different operating systems, such as Linux and macOS.

## Moving Runners Between Groups
- Runners can be moved between groups if needed.
- However, each runner can only be in one group at a time.
- To move a runner to a different group, remove it from the current group and add it to the desired group.
- This can be done through the runner management interface or by using the appropriate commands.

Note: The provided information is based on the student's notes and does not include any additional information. # Configuring Self-Hosted Runners

When configuring self-hosted runners, there are a few important things to keep in mind:

## 1. Create a dedicated user for the action runner service
- It is advisable to create a dedicated user specifically for the action runner service. This helps avoid potential issues such as password expiration.
- By having a dedicated user, you can ensure that the runner service can run without any interruptions or authentication problems.

## 2. Enable limited sudo access
- Most actions may require running pseudo commands for certain operations.
- Instead of granting root permissions, it is recommended to enable limited sudo access.
- This helps maintain security by restricting the actions that can be performed by the runner or environment.

## 3. Consider creating multiple pools with specific tools
- It is beneficial to create multiple pools of runners with specific tools.
- For example, you can have separate runners for building and deploying Java applications, and another set of runners for building and deploying .NET applications.
- While it is not a requirement to have separate runners for different languages, it can be advantageous, especially in larger teams or organizations.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a more secure and efficient configuration for self-hosted runners. # Running Actions in Docker
- It is advisable to have multiple pools for running or executing actions inside an enterprise.
- Currently, executing the individual actions inside Docker is supported, but running the runner itself inside Docker is not supported.
- There are workarounds available online to make the runners run inside Docker, allowing for scalability and running them inside Kubernetes or Cloud Foundry.
- However, officially, running the runner inside Docker is not supported.
- The main reason for this limitation is that the execution of Docker actions when running a runner inside Docker does not work.
- Many actions require Docker to work, which is a significant limitation at the moment.
- It is important to note that executing the runners inside Docker is not officially supported, despite the availability of workarounds.
- This limitation should be considered when planning the execution environment for actions. # Main Topic: GitHub Actions and Self-Hosted Runners

## Self-Hosted Runners with Public Repos
- Technically, self-hosted runners can work with public repos if Docker actions are not used.
- However, GitHub does not officially support this configuration at the moment.
- It is advised not to use or recommend self-hosted runners with public repos due to various reasons previously mentioned.

## Dynamically Scaling Runners
- Even if Docker runners are not used, there are different ways to dynamically scan and scale runners based on the infrastructure being used.
- The following example is for AWS, but there are also examples available for Azure, other cloud providers, and on-premises solutions like Cloud Foundry or Redshift.
- These examples are community projects, not first-party projects, but they are widely used globally.

# Main Topic: Secrets Management in GitHub Actions

## Using Secrets
- GitHub Actions can utilize secrets, and it is recommended to use them.
- GitHub already provides some secrets, such as the g...

(Note: The provided text is incomplete and cuts off abruptly. Please provide the complete text for a more accurate transformation into smart notes.) # GitHub Token

A GitHub token is a token that is automatically available to all actions running in a specific repository. It provides access to the repository and allows actions to interact with it. While it is not required to use the token, some actions may require it. The token is passed within the environment variables for the specific action. 

- The token is automatically generated and available as a secret.
- Each action execution generates a different token, making it difficult to grab and use.
- Secrets can also be manually created and saved in the repository or organization.

# Secrets

Secrets are a way to securely store sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens, in a repository or organization. They can be used by actions that require this information without exposing it in the code.

- Secrets can be created and saved in the repository or organization settings.
- They are encrypted and can only be accessed by actions running in the repository or organization.
- Secrets are passed to actions as environment variables.

Example:
```
steps:
  - name: My Action
    env:
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
    run: |
      # Use the secret in the action
      echo $MY_SECRET
```

In the example above, the `MY_SECRET` secret is accessed by the action and used in the `run` command.

# Using GitHub Token and Secrets

GitHub token and secrets can be used together to provide secure access to repositories and perform actions that require authentication.

- GitHub token can be used to interact with the repository itself.
- Secrets can be used to store and access sensitive information required by actions.

Example:
```
steps:
  - name: My Action
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
    run: |
      # Use the GitHub token and secret in the action
      echo $GITHUB_TOKEN
      echo $MY_SECRET
```

In the example above, both the GitHub token and the `MY_SECRET` secret are accessed by the action and used in the `run` command. # Secrets Management in Gita

## Introduction
Gita provides a way to manage secrets, which are sensitive information like API keys or passwords, that are needed for your workflows. There are different types of secrets in Gita, including organization secrets and repository secrets.

## Organization Secrets
- Organization secrets are defined at the organizational level.
- They can be used by all the repositories within that organization.
- Organization secrets can be scoped to all repositories or specific repositories.
- However, organization secrets are not available in the free plan.
- They are only available if you have a paid plan.

## Repository Secrets
- Repository secrets are available with any plan, including the free one.
- They are scoped to a single repository.
- Repository secrets can be used to override organization secrets.
- For example, if there is a secret named "abc" at the organization level and you create a secret named "abc" at the repository level, the actions will use the repository secret instead.
- If a repository secret is not defined, it will fall back to using the organization secret.

## Managing Secrets
- Secrets can be managed using the Gita web UI or the CLI (command-line interface).
- The web UI provides a user-friendly interface for managing secrets.
- The CLI allows you to manage secrets using commands.
- However, the CLI has some limitations that we will discuss later.
- Secrets can also be accessed via APIs, allowing for programmatic management.

## Limitations of CLI
- The CLI for managing secrets in Gita has some limitations.
- These limitations will be discussed in detail later.

Note: It is important to handle secrets securely and follow best practices to protect sensitive information. # Secrets in GitHub Actions

## Environment Secrets
- Secrets that apply to a specific environment
- Override both organization and repository secrets
- Only users with specific permissions to the environment can add and edit these secrets

## Hierarchy of Secrets
1. Organization Secrets (higher level)
2. Repository Secrets
3. Environment Secrets (underneath repository secrets)

## Secret Lookup Order
- When a GitHub Action runs, it checks for the presence of a secret in the following order:
1. Environment: If the secret is present in the environment, it is used.
2. Repository: If the secret is not found in the environment, it falls back to the repository secrets.
3. Organization: If the action is in an organization context and the secret is not found in the repository, it falls back to the organization secrets.

## Limitations of Secrets
- Secrets have some limitations:
1. Limited to a specific environment, repository, or organization.
2. Cannot be accessed outside the scope they are defined in.
3. Cannot be shared between different environments, repositories, or organizations.
4. Cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.

Note: If a specific secret is not present in the organization, repository, or environment, the action will fail as it won't be able to find that specific secret. # Secrets in GitHub Actions

## Secrets cannot be read in apps
- Even if an app interacts with actions, it cannot read secrets.
- The Actions API does not have a resource for the value of secrets.
- APIs do not provide secrets.

## Secrets are not passed to workflows in forked repositories
- If you execute workflows in a forked repository, the secrets are not passed to the workflow.
- Forked repositories do not have access to the secrets by default.
- You can enable access to secrets for private repositories, but it is not recommended to have different secrets for forked repositories.

## Limitations on secrets
- There is a limit on the number of secrets that can be used, which is 100.
- Each secret has a limitation on its size, which is 64 kilobytes.
- If you need to store something larger than 64 kilobytes, you can encrypt the secret and store it in a file. # Using GPG to Encrypt and Save Files

To bypass the size limitation of saving files, you can use GPG encryption. Here's how you can do it:

1. Save the file you want to encrypt on your local machine.
2. Use GPG to encrypt the file. This will create an encrypted version of the file.
3. Save the encrypted file in your preferred location, such as your Ripple (a file storage system).
4. Save the encryption key as a secret in your repository or organization. This will allow you to access the encrypted file when needed.

# Organizational Secrets

Organizational secrets are a way to securely store sensitive information within your organization. Here's how you can use them:

1. Access the organization's secrets section.
2. Create a new secret by providing a name and a value.
3. Choose the repository to which you want to scope the secret. It can be all repositories, only private repositories, or specific repositories within your organization.
4. Save the secret.
5. You can update or remove the secret later, but you won't be able to see its value.
6. This is a security feature to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the secrets.

Note: It's important to keep secrets secure and ensure that no one can access them without proper authorization.

# GitHub Secrets

GitHub Secrets are a way to securely store sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens, that are used in GitHub Actions workflows. Secrets are encrypted and can only be accessed by authorized users or actions.

## Repository Secrets
- Repository Secrets are secrets that are scoped only to a specific repository.
- To create a repository secret, go to the repository's settings and navigate to the Secrets tab.
- Click on "New repository secret" and provide a name and value for the secret.
- Repository secrets can be updated or removed, but their values cannot be viewed.

## Environment Secrets
- Environment Secrets are secrets that are scoped to a specific environment within a repository.
- To define environment secrets, go to the repository's settings and navigate to the Environments tab.
- Select the desired environment and click on "Edit environment".
- Under the "Secrets" section, you can define secrets specific to that environment.
- Environment secrets can be updated or removed, but their values cannot be viewed.

## Example
In this example, there are two secrets with the same name, "azure subscription id", in the repository.
- One secret is defined at the repository level, which means it is automatically scoped only to that repository.
- The other secret is defined in the production environment, which means it is specific to that environment within the repository.
- Both secrets can be updated or removed, but their values cannot be viewed.

By using GitHub Secrets, you can securely store and manage sensitive information within your GitHub repositories, ensuring that only authorized users or actions can access them. # Secrets in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allows you to store and use secrets in your workflows. Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be used to securely store sensitive information such as API keys, access tokens, or passwords.

## Storing Secrets

To store a secret in GitHub Actions, follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets".
4. Click on "New repository secret".
5. Enter a name for your secret and its value.
6. Click on "Add secret" to save it.

## Using Secrets in Workflows

Once you have stored a secret, you can use it in your workflows. Secrets can be accessed using the `secrets` context in GitHub Actions.

To use a secret in a workflow:

- Use the following notation: `${{ secrets.NAME_OF_YOUR_SECRET }}`, where `NAME_OF_YOUR_SECRET` is the name you gave to your secret.

## Secret Scoping

Secrets can be scoped to different environments, such as development, staging, or production. This allows you to have different values for the same secret in different environments.

- When deploying to development or staging, if a specific secret is not defined for that environment, GitHub Actions will use the default secret.
- When deploying to production, GitHub Actions will use the secret specific to that environment, overwriting any other secret.

## Logging Secrets

It is important to note that even if you try to log your secrets in GitHub Actions, you will not see the actual value of the secret. This is done for security reasons to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use a secret in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Example Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Print secret value
        run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on a push to the `main` branch. It checks out the code and then prints the value of the secret `MY_SECRET`. # Flow and Parameters in Workflows

In GitHub workflows, you can manually trigger the flow or set it to run automatically based on certain events. You can also add parameters to the workflow to customize its behavior.

## Manual Flow and Event-based Flow
- You can manually trigger a workflow to run.
- Workflows can also be set to run automatically based on specific events, such as a push to a repository or the creation of a pull request.

## Adding Parameters to Workflows
- Parameters allow you to add specific custom fields to your workflow.
- These parameters can be used to input values or make selections that will be passed to the workflow.
- This allows you to customize the workflow's behavior based on the input provided.

# Logging and Security in Workflows

When running a workflow, it is important to consider logging and security measures to protect sensitive information.

## Logging Secret Values
- GitHub provides a security feature that prevents the logging of secret values.
- When running a workflow, secret values are replaced by stars (*) in the logs.
- This ensures that sensitive information is not exposed in the logs.

## Integrating with Third-Party Secret Providers
- GitHub does not currently have the capability to directly integrate with third-party secret providers like Azure Key Vault.
- However, in the GitHub Marketplace, there are actions available for consuming secrets from third-party providers.
- For example, you can use the "Key Vault" action to connect to your Azure Key Vault and fetch one or more secrets.
- These secrets can then be set as output variables for use in your workflow. # Smart Notes: Actions in GitHub

## Execution of Actions
Actions in GitHub can be executed in a workflow. When executing an action, it is important to note that the secrets used in the action can be referenced from the output variables of that specific action. This allows for easy access to secrets in the workflow.

## API Usage in Actions
Actions in GitHub can be performed using APIs. Almost everything that can be done through the UI in actions can also be done via APIs. However, it is important to note that the value of secrets cannot be seen through APIs. The APIs can be used to manage and update secrets, as well as perform other actions such as accessing and managing artifacts, checking workflow status, and triggering actions.

## Automation Parameters in Repository Dispatch
When using automation parameters in a repository dispatch, a specific syntax is used to pass basic parameters. These parameters can be used to automate actions and workflows in GitHub. # Smart Notes: Understanding Event Names and Client Payloads

## Event Names and Client Payloads
- Event names are used to reference specific events in an execution.
- Client payloads are used to pass data to an action or API.

## Using Event Names in Executions
- Event names can be referenced as client payloads in an execution.
- This allows for easy identification and retrieval of specific events.
- Example: `client payload` can be used to reference an event name.

## Using Client Payloads in Actions
- Client payloads can contain parameters and boolean variables.
- These can be passed to other actions using the `client payload` keyword.
- Example: `client payload` with `param a` and boolean variables can be passed to another action.

## Using Client Payloads with APIs
- APIs can also use client payloads to consume data.
- You can create your own event type using a JSON payload.
- This allows you to consume the data in your action workflow.
- Example: Create an event type with a JSON payload and consume it in your action workflow.

## Using If Clauses to Influence Execution
- If clauses can be used to apply conditions to actions or jobs.
- If the condition is matched, the action will run.
- This can be used to influence the execution of an action.
- Example: Use an if clause to determine if an action should run based on a condition.

## Using If Clauses in Actions
- If clauses can be used within an action to control its execution.
- This allows for conditional logic within an action.
- Example: Use an if clause within an action to determine if it should run based on a condition.

## Using If Clauses in Jobs
- If clauses can also be used in jobs to influence the execution of actions.
- This allows for conditional execution of actions within a job.
- Example: Use an if clause in a job to determine if an action should run based on a condition. # Job Execution Conditions

In a job, you can use conditions to control when the job should be executed. These conditions can be expressed as literals, variables, or output parameters from other jobs. 

## Literal Conditions
- You can use a literal condition to specify a specific value that must be met for the job to execute. For example, you can use the `if` statement to execute a job only if a certain condition is true. 

## Variable Conditions
- You can also use variables to define conditions for job execution. These variables can be set based on the results of previous jobs or actions. For example, you can set a variable to indicate whether the job should be executed based on the results of a previous job. 

## Output Parameters
- Output parameters from other jobs can also be used as conditions for job execution. For example, if you have a job that is supposed to do something and you want to condition the next execution of the job based on the results of the previous job, you can use the output parameter from the previous job as a condition. 

## Real Example
- Let's say you have a job called "Deploy to Dev" and you only want to execute this job if you are coming from a pull request. In this case, you can use the `if` statement with a condition that checks if the job is coming from a pull request. 
- Similarly, if you have a job called "Deploy to Staging" and you only want to execute this job if you are coming from the main branch, you can use the `if` statement with a condition that checks if the job is coming from the main branch. 

By using conditions in your job execution, you can control when and how your jobs are executed based on specific criteria or results from previous jobs.
